## How to style the backdrop of the HTML dialog element using Tailwind CSS

**To style a native HTML dialog's backdrop, use the `backdrop:` modifier introduced in Tailwind CSS 3.1.**

```html
<dialog class="backdrop:bg-black/50 backdrop:backdrop-blur-md">
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
</dialog>
```

[I made a working CodePen](https://codepen.io/benjamincrozat/pen/poGERgV) for those curious to see how all this works.

(Using the class to add a backdrop filter to the dialog's backdrop is a bit weird, but it works!)

## Browser support for the HTML dialog element

I was surprised to see how well this relatively new dialog HTML element is supported.

At the time I'm writing these lines, the `dialog` element is supported by:
- Firefox 98+
- Firefox for Android 118+
- Google Chrome 37+
- Google Chrome for Android 128+
- Opera 24+
- Safari/Mobile Safari 15.4+

[Check out the support chart on Can I use](https://caniuse.com/dialog).
