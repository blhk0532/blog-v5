## Introduction to Laravel's whereIn() method in the query builder

When you're diving into [Laravel's query builder](https://laravel.com/docs/queries), one of the handy tools in your arsenal is the `whereIn()` method.

It's a straightforward yet powerful way to filter your database queries. 

Think of it like a tool helping you pick exactly what you need from a list of items in your database.

## How whereIn() works

Imagine you have a list of user IDs, and you need to fetch users that match these IDs from your database.

That's where Laravel's query builder `whereIn()` method comes into play.

It allows you to specify a column, like `user_id`, and a set of values. The framework then fetches rows where the column's value is in the provided set.

## Using whereIn() in your code

Here's a quick example:

```php
$users = User::whereIn('id', [1, 2, 3])->get();
```

In this snippet, the `whereIn()` method is fetching users whose `id` is either 1, 2, or 3.

Without `whereIn()`, you whould have to do something like this:

```php
$users = User::where('id', 1)
	->orWhere('id', 2)
	->orWhere('id', 3)
	->get();
```

## When not to use whereIn()

While `whereIn()` is handy, it's important to use it wisely.

If you have a massive array of items you're filtering by, this can slow down your query. So, always try to limit the size of the array you pass to `whereIn()`.

Instead, I would try to find the common denominator between all those items and use that to run my queries faster.

If filtering data is where the query starts getting messy, these are the next Laravel reads I would open:

- [Write where clauses with fewer query-builder surprises](/laravel-query-builder-where-clauses)
- [Sort Eloquent results cleanly with orderBy](/laravel-order-by)
- [Validate nested arrays in Laravel without losing your mind](/laravel-array-validation)
- [Write validation rules with less guesswork](/laravel-validation)
- [Use database transactions when partial writes would hurt](/database-transactions-laravel)
