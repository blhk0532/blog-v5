To publish additional configuration files in Laravel 11, use:

```bash
php artisan config:publish
```

Laravel will then ask you to choose which configuration file you want to publish.

And by the way, you can also publish them all at once using:

```bash
php artisan config:publish --all
```

Why is this necessary now? Because starting from [Laravel 11](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/releases), new projects get to experience a slimmer skeleton. Part of the efforts to make it happen was:
- Cleaning up the configuration files (some values were actually [removed](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/commit/f437205a5e11e6fd5ea64e4adc30ab155131c79f)).
- Updating the _.env.example_ file with more environment variables to make the framework more configurable in one place.
- Reducing the amount of published files, which can be overwhelming for new developers. For instance, the _cors.php_, _hashing.php_, and _view.php_ files are missing.

If you are still adapting to the slimmer Laravel 11 skeleton after this, these are the next reads I would keep nearby:

- [Restore Laravel 11 route files when you actually need them](/install-route-files-laravel)
- [Adjust Laravel 11 middleware without hunting through the framework](/customize-middleware-laravel-11)
- [Check what changes before you move to Laravel 11](/laravel-11-upgrade-guide)
