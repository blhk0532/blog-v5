## Introduction

**A Laravel pivot table is the table that connects two models in a many-to-many relationship.**

If you have `users` and `roles`, the pivot table stores which user has which role:

```text
users ───< role_user >─── roles

role_user
- user_id
- role_id
- granted_by
- expires_at
- created_at
- updated_at
```

That is the mental model. The rest is just wiring it into Eloquent correctly.

Here is the same relationship as a quick diagram, including the extra fields that belong on the pivot table itself:

![Diagram of users and roles connected by a role_user pivot table in Laravel](https://imagedelivery.net/hYERsDhHaFG137wdGnWeuA/images/posts/laravel-pivot-table-relationship-diagram.png/public)

This guide walks through one real example from start to finish:

- the migration
- the `belongsToMany()` relationships
- extra pivot fields
- `attach()`, `sync()`, `syncWithoutDetaching()`, and `updateExistingPivot()`

## When you need a pivot table in Laravel

Use a pivot table when one record can belong to many others on both sides.

Typical examples:

- users and roles
- posts and tags
- products and categories
- students and courses

If each side only belongs to one record on the other side, this is not a pivot-table problem. That is usually a `belongsTo()` / `hasMany()` relationship instead.

## The example we will build

We will use this relationship:

- one user can have many roles
- one role can belong to many users
- the pivot table also stores who granted the role and when it expires

That means we need three tables:

- `users`
- `roles`
- `role_user`

## Create the pivot table migration

Laravel expects the default pivot table name to be the two related model names in alphabetical order, singular, joined with an underscore.

So for `User` and `Role`, the conventional table name is:

```text
role_user
```

Here is a migration that works well:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('role_user', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
            $table->foreignId('role_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
            $table->foreignId('granted_by')->nullable()->constrained('users')->nullOnDelete();
            $table->timestamp('expires_at')->nullable();
            $table->timestamps();

            $table->primary(['user_id', 'role_id']);
        });
    }

    public function down(): void
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('role_user');
    }
};
```

Why this version is solid:

- `foreignId()->constrained()` gives you proper foreign keys
- the composite primary key prevents duplicate `user_id` + `role_id` pairs
- `timestamps()` lets you see when the relationship was created or updated
- extra pivot fields stay on the pivot table, not the `users` or `roles` tables

If you want a refresher on migrations before doing this, [this Laravel migrations guide](/laravel-migrations) is the right companion.

## Define the many-to-many relationship in your models

### In `User.php`

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;

class User extends Model
{
    public function roles(): BelongsToMany
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class)
            ->withPivot(['granted_by', 'expires_at'])
            ->withTimestamps();
    }
}
```

### In `Role.php`

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;

class Role extends Model
{
    public function users(): BelongsToMany
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(User::class)
            ->withPivot(['granted_by', 'expires_at'])
            ->withTimestamps();
    }
}
```

The important pieces are:

- `belongsToMany()` tells Laravel this is many-to-many
- `withPivot()` tells Laravel which extra pivot columns to expose
- `withTimestamps()` tells Laravel to manage the pivot table timestamps

## Read pivot data

Once the relationship is loaded, Laravel exposes the intermediate record through the `pivot` property:

```php
$user = User::with('roles')->findOrFail(1);

foreach ($user->roles as $role) {
    echo $role->name;
    echo $role->pivot->granted_by;
    echo $role->pivot->expires_at;
}
```

That is the cleanest way to read extra metadata that belongs to the relationship itself.

## Attach related models

Use `attach()` when you want to add a relationship without replacing existing ones.

```php
$user->roles()->attach($roleId);
```

If the pivot table has extra fields, pass them in the second argument:

```php
$user->roles()->attach($roleId, [
    'granted_by' => auth()->id(),
    'expires_at' => now()->addMonth(),
]);
```

This is a good fit when you are adding one or a few new relationships and you know they are not already attached.

## Sync related models

Use `sync()` when you want the pivot table to match one exact set of IDs.

```php
$user->roles()->sync([1, 2, 3]);
```

After that call:

- roles `1`, `2`, and `3` stay attached
- anything else gets detached

You can also sync with extra pivot data:

```php
$user->roles()->sync([
    1 => ['granted_by' => auth()->id()],
    2 => ['granted_by' => auth()->id(), 'expires_at' => now()->addWeek()],
]);
```

This is the right method when the submitted form or settings screen represents the full desired state.

## Avoid accidental detaches with `syncWithoutDetaching()`

Sometimes you want sync-like behavior without removing existing records.

```php
$user->roles()->syncWithoutDetaching([
    3 => ['granted_by' => auth()->id()],
]);
```

This attaches the missing role but leaves the existing ones alone.

It is a better fit than `sync()` when “add this role too” is the requirement.

## Update existing pivot rows

If the relationship already exists and you just want to change the pivot data, use `updateExistingPivot()`.

```php
$user->roles()->updateExistingPivot($roleId, [
    'expires_at' => now()->addMonths(3),
    'granted_by' => auth()->id(),
]);
```

This is cleaner than detaching and reattaching just to change metadata.

## Common pitfalls

### Duplicate rows in the pivot table

If you do not enforce uniqueness, it is easy to attach the same pair twice. The composite primary key in the migration prevents that.

### Wrong pivot table name

Laravel expects the alphabetical singular naming convention by default. If your table name does not follow that convention, pass it explicitly:

```php
return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class, 'user_roles');
```

### Forgetting `withPivot()`

If you do not add the extra columns to `withPivot()`, they will exist in the database but not be available on `$role->pivot`.

### Using `sync()` when you really meant “attach one more”

This is a classic production bug. `sync()` removes anything not in the provided list.

If you only mean to add one relationship, use `attach()` or `syncWithoutDetaching()` instead.

## Practical controller example

Here is a simple example of granting roles from a request:

```php
public function updateRoles(Request $request, User $user): RedirectResponse
{
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'roles' => ['array'],
        'roles.*.id' => ['required', 'integer', 'exists:roles,id'],
        'roles.*.expires_at' => ['nullable', 'date'],
    ]);

    $syncData = collect($validated['roles'] ?? [])
        ->mapWithKeys(fn (array $role) => [
            $role['id'] => [
                'granted_by' => auth()->id(),
                'expires_at' => $role['expires_at'] ?? null,
            ],
        ])
        ->all();

    $user->roles()->sync($syncData);

    return back();
}
```

This is a good real-world pattern because it makes the request payload the source of truth.

If you are validating nested request arrays like this often, [this Laravel array validation guide](/laravel-array-validation) is worth keeping nearby.

## Conclusion

Laravel pivot tables are just many-to-many relationships with an intermediate table. Once the mental model is clear, the main decisions are straightforward:

- use `belongsToMany()` on both models
- use `withPivot()` for extra fields
- use `attach()` to add
- use `sync()` to replace the full set
- use `syncWithoutDetaching()` to add without removing
- use `updateExistingPivot()` to change existing pivot metadata

If you are still wiring relationships and database structure in Laravel, these are the next reads I would keep open:

- [Get the migration side right before you touch the relationship](/laravel-migrations)
- [Write nested validation rules without losing track of the payload](/laravel-array-validation)
- [Keep multi-step writes safe with database transactions](/database-transactions-laravel)
