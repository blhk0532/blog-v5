## Introduction

**Use [`isset()`](https://www.php.net/isset) when you want to know whether a variable or array key exists and is not `null`.**

```php
$user = ['name' => 'Ben'];

var_dump(isset($user['name']));
var_dump(isset($user['email']));

// true
// false
```

That sounds simple, but `isset()` is one of those PHP helpers that keeps causing confusion because it overlaps with [`empty()`](https://www.php.net/empty), `??`, and [`array_key_exists()`](https://www.php.net/array_key_exists).

The most important rule is this:

- `isset()` returns `false` when the value is missing
- `isset()` also returns `false` when the value exists but is `null`

That is why this article is really about choosing the right tool, not just memorizing one function.

## What `isset()` actually checks

`isset()` returns `true` only when the variable or array key exists **and** its value is not `null`.

```php
$data = [
    'name' => 'Ben',
    'email' => null,
];

var_dump(isset($data['name']));
var_dump(isset($data['email']));
var_dump(isset($data['missing']));

// true
// false
// false
```

That makes it useful for optional input, nested array access, and any situation where `null` should count as “not available.”

## Simple `isset()` examples

### Check whether an array key is available

```php
$post = ['title' => 'Laravel tips'];

if (isset($post['title'])) {
    echo $post['title'];
}
```

This is a common pattern when reading request data, config arrays, or decoded JSON.

### Check nested keys without notices

`isset()` is handy here because it does not complain when an intermediate key is missing:

```php
$data = [];

var_dump(isset($data['user']['email']));

// false
```

That is one reason it stayed popular for so long in older PHP code.

### Check several values at once

`isset()` can check multiple variables or keys in one call:

```php
$user = [
    'name' => 'Ben',
    'email' => 'ben@example.com',
];

var_dump(isset($user['name'], $user['email']));

// true
```

If any one of them is missing or `null`, the whole result becomes `false`.

## `isset()` vs `empty()`

This is the comparison people usually need.

`isset()` answers:

> Does this exist and is it not `null`?

`empty()` answers:

> Does this look empty in a boolean sense?

That means `empty()` treats `0`, `'0'`, `''`, `false`, `[]`, and `null` as empty.

```php
$values = [
    'count' => 0,
    'name' => '',
    'flag' => false,
];

var_dump(isset($values['count']), empty($values['count']));
var_dump(isset($values['name']), empty($values['name']));
var_dump(isset($values['flag']), empty($values['flag']));

// true, true
// true, true
// true, true
```

So if `0`, `''`, or `false` are valid values in your app, `empty()` is usually the wrong check.

If that specific comparison is what you are dealing with, [this PHP array length guide](/php-array-length) is the better deep dive because it covers `count()` and empty-array checks side by side.

## `isset()` vs `??`

The null coalescing operator is often cleaner than `isset()` when your real goal is a fallback value.

Instead of this:

```php
$name = isset($_GET['name']) ? $_GET['name'] : 'Unknown';
```

Prefer this:

```php
$name = $_GET['name'] ?? 'Unknown';
```

Both use the same basic semantics: missing or `null` means “use the fallback.”

The difference is that `??` reads more clearly when you want a value, not just a boolean check.

If that is the pattern you use most, [this null coalescing operator guide](/php-double-question-mark-null-coalescing-operator) pairs nicely with this article.

## `isset()` vs `array_key_exists()`

This is the most important distinction after `empty()`.

If `null` is a meaningful value, `isset()` is not enough.

```php
$data = ['missing' => null];

var_dump(isset($data['missing']));
var_dump(array_key_exists('missing', $data));

// false
// true
```

So:

- use `isset()` when `null` should count as missing
- use `array_key_exists()` when you need to know whether the key exists even if its value is `null`

This matters a lot when `null` is part of your business logic instead of just “not set yet.”

## Practical examples

### Form input where an empty string is still a real value

```php
$post = ['email' => ''];

var_dump(isset($post['email']));
var_dump(empty($post['email']));
var_dump($post['email'] ?? 'fallback');

// true
// true
// ""
```

This is a good illustration of the tradeoff:

- `isset()` says the key is present
- `empty()` says the value is empty
- `??` returns the actual value because it is not `null`

### Optional nested data

```php
$payload = [];

$email = $payload['user']['email'] ?? null;
```

This is usually cleaner than wrapping a nested `isset()` check around an assignment.

### Config values that should not treat `0` as missing

```php
$config = ['retry_count' => 0];

if (isset($config['retry_count'])) {
    echo $config['retry_count'];
}
```

This works because `0` is not `null`, so `isset()` still returns `true`.

## When `isset()` is the right choice

Use `isset()` when all of these are true:

- you need a yes-or-no check
- missing and `null` should behave the same way
- values like `0`, `false`, and `''` should still count as present

If any of those assumptions is wrong, another tool is usually clearer.

## Conclusion

`isset()` is useful, but only when you are precise about what it means. It does not tell you whether a value is truthy or non-empty. It tells you whether something exists and is not `null`.

If you are still sorting out these tiny PHP checks that cause bigger bugs than they should, these are the next reads I would keep open:

- [Use `??` when a fallback value is the real goal](/php-double-question-mark-null-coalescing-operator)
- [Count arrays correctly before you branch on them](/php-array-length)
- [Decode request or API data more safely in PHP](/php-json-decode)
